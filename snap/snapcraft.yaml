description: |
  Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more
  functionality behind a single, common interface.

  Ruff can be used to replace [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) (plus a variety of plugins), [`isort`](https://pypi.org/project/isort/),
  [`pydocstyle`](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/), [`yesqa`](https://github.com/asottile/yesqa),
  [`eradicate`](https://pypi.org/project/eradicate/), [`pyupgrade`](https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade/),
  and [`autoflake`](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/), all while executing tens or hundreds of
  times faster than any individual tool.

  Ruff goes beyond the responsibilities of a traditional linter, instead functioning as an advanced
  code transformation tool capable of upgrading type annotations, rewriting class definitions, sorting
  imports, and more.
